# Nextflow QC, Alignment, and Variant Calling Pipeline
## Overview
This project implements a basic **Nextflow pipeline** for preprocessing, alignment, and variant calling of sequencing data.  
The pipeline performs **quality control, trimming, post-trimming quality check, read alignment, and variant calling** on a single FASTQ file.

## Pipeline Flow 

Raw FASTQ  
↓  
FastQC (Raw Reads)  
↓  
Trimming  
↓  
FastQC (Trimmed Reads)  
↓  
Alignment (BAM)  
↓  
Variant Calling (VCF)

## Pipeline Steps

### Step 1: Raw Read Quality Control (FastQC)
- Performs quality assessment on the raw FASTQ file
- Generates reports for base quality, GC content, and adapter contamination  
**Tool used:**  
- FastQC  

### Step 2: Read Trimming
- Removes low-quality bases and adapters from raw reads  
- Improves read quality for downstream analysis  
**Tool used:**  
- Trimmomatic (Single-end mode)  

### Step 3: Quality Control After Trimming
- Runs FastQC again on the trimmed reads  
- Confirms improvement in read quality after trimming  
**Tool used:**  
- FastQC  

### Step 4: Read Alignment
- Aligns trimmed reads to the reference genome  
- Produces alignment output in BAM format  
- BAM file is generated inside the Nextflow `work/` directory  
**Tool used:**  
- Aligner configured in the pipeline  

### Step 5: Variant Calling
- Detects genetic variants from aligned BAM files  
- Produces variant output in VCF format  
**Tool used:**  
- bcftools  

## Input Data
Single FASTQ file: data/sample_R1.fastq
Reference genome: data/reference/chr22.fa
Input data is used locally for execution and is **not included** in the GitHub repository.

## Output
- FastQC reports (raw and trimmed)  
- Trimmed FASTQ file  
- Alignment output (BAM and BAI files)  
- Variant output (VCF file)  

All outputs are stored in the Nextflow `work/` directory by default.
